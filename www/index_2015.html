<h2>The party is already over. Thanks to all participants.</h2>
The site will stay online (at least for a while ;).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> -->
At the <a href="http://wien.linuxwochen.at/">Linuxwochen</a> 2015 in Vienna (7-9 May), an OpenPGP (pgp/gpg) Keysigning Party will be held.
<p>
<!-- The party is going to take place in A1.07 at 11.30. -->
<!--The party is going to take place on.<br>-->

<h2>What is/Why keysigning?</h2>
Please read section I of the
<a href="http://alfie.ist.org/projects/gpg-party/gpg-party#toc1">GnuPG Keysigning Party HOWTO</a>
(note: we are doing the party a bit differently, so the other chapters
do not apply 100%).

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>
The party will be conducted using Len Sassaman's
<a href="keysigning.txt">Efficient Group Key Signing Method</a>:

<ul>
<li>
If you intend to participate, please send your key to our keyserver:
 <code>gpg --keyserver hkp://ksp.linuxwochen.at --send YOURKEYID</code> until 
<!-- <strong>Thursday, May 3rd, 2012 - 23:59</strong>.<br>-->
<p>

If your key is not listed at <a href="/keys/">http://ksp.linuxwochen.at/keys/</a>
after submission, please <a href='mailto:bernhard.miklautz@shacknet.at'>contact me</a> personally.

<!-- <p>
<strong>This deadline has now passed.
If you haven't submitted your key yet, it's too late.</strong>
<p>
If you still want to participate, please follow the instructions listed below, like everybody else (i.e. grab the file, check the checksum and bring
a printout with you) in order to sign other people's keys.
<p>
In addition, print out your key information on small slips of paper and bring enough for everyone (say 20 or so). -->


<li>
By Wednesday, May xxth 2015, you will be able to fetch both the complete keyring with
all the keys that were submitted, along with a text file
(<a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>) containing the fingerprint of each key on the ring.
<li>
At home, verify that the fingerprint of your key in <a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>
is correct.  Also, compute the sha256/ripemd160 hash of <a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>. One way to do this is
by invoking gpg as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
   <code>% gpg --print-md ripemd160 ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Just to be sure you have no problems with the download, here is the ripemd160 hash as we have calculated it:
<blockquote>
    <code>4A17 .... .... .... ....  .... .... .... .... 52A9</code>
</blockquote>

  Note that this is just a hint - you must do the check yourself!
<p>

We will also read the SHA256 hash, so you should calculate that one too (<code>gpg --print-md sha256</code>).<br><br>

<li>
At the Linuxwochen Keysigning Party, come with the hashes you computed plus a hardcopy of
<a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>.

<li>
A reader at the front of the room will recite the ripemd160/sha256 hash of
<a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>.  
Verify that the hash recited matches what you
computed. This guarantees that all participants are working from the same list
of keys.

<li>
In turn, each participant will stand and acknowledge that the fingerprint of
his or her key listed is correct. Mark the key verified on your hardcopy.
Since we already ensured that everybody has the same copy a simple statement
like "<em>yes, this information is correct</em>" is sufficient.

<li>
The next step is to verify each participant's identity by checking his or her
passport or similar form of ID.

<li>
Later that evening, or perhaps when you get home, you can sign those keys
which you were able to verify. After you signed a key, send it to its owner together with
your signature.

<h2>Summary: What to bring with you</h2>

<ul>
<li>A printout of <a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a>; check that your fingerprint is
correct!</li>
<li>The sha256/ripemd160 hash you made of <a href="ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt"><code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code></a> so that we can ensure we are all working with the same copy.</li>
<li>Some form of government issued ID (passport or similar).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="caff">caff</a></h2>

<p>
CA Fire and Forget is a script that helps you in keysigning. It takes a list
of keyids on the command line, fetches them from a keyserver and calls GnuPG so
that you can sign it. It then mails each key to all its email addresses - only
including the one UID that we send to in each mail, pruned from all but self
sigs and sigs done by you.

<p>
Download it: <a href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pgp-tools/trunk/caff/"><code>caff</code></a>.

<p>
Depends: gnupg (&gt;= 1.3.92), perl, libgnupg-interface-perl, libmime-perl, libmailtools-perl (&gt;= 1.62)

<h2><a name="gpgsigs">gpgsigs</a></h2>

<p>
Uli Martens wrote a small perl script that, given a key ID and <code>ksp-linuxwochen-wien-15.txt</code>
tells you which keys (UIDs) you already signed by annotating the UID with
<code>(S)</code>.

<pre>
153  [ ] Fingerprint OK        [ ] ID OK
(S)  pub  1024D/52698E9F 2001-11-07 Uli Martens &lt;uli@youam.net&gt;
     Key fingerprint = A48F 8894 37A0 FDE9 60D5  212A 2A58 CEAA 5269 8E9F
(S)  uid     Uli Martens &lt;isax@gmx.de&gt;
( )  uid     Uli Martens &lt;u.martens@youam.com&gt;
(S)  uid     Uli Martens &lt;u.martens@scientific.de&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Download it: <a href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pgp-tools/trunk/gpgsigs/"><code>gpgsigs</code></a>.

<p>
It requires perl, gnupg (&gt;=1.2.x) and either Locale::Recode (in Debian
Package libintl-perl, in testing and unstable) or recode (Debian Package
recode).
<p>
On Debian cuff an gpgsigs is found in signing-party.
